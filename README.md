# Opensource Tools used
1. eSim: eSim (previously known as Oscad / FreeEDA) is a free/libre and open source EDA tool for circuit design, simulation, analysis and PCB design developed by FOSSEE, IIT Bombay. It is an integrated tool    built using free/libre and open source software such as KiCad, Ngspice and GHDL. eSim is released under GPL. eSim offers similar capabilities and ease of use as any equivalent proprietary software for schematic creation, simulation and PCB design, without having to pay a huge amount of money to procure licenses. Hence it can be an affordable alternative to educational institutions and SMEs. It can serve as an alternative to commercially available/licensed software tools like OrCAD, Xpedition and HSPICE. For more info refer: https://esim.fossee.in/home

2. Ngspice: Ngspice is the open source spice simulator for electric and electronic circuits. Ngspice offers a wealth of device models for active, passive, analog, and digital elements. Model parameters are provided by the semiconductor manufacturers. The user add her circuits as a netlist, and the output is one or more graphs of currents, voltages and other electrical quantities or is saved in a data file. For more info refer: http://ngspice.sourceforge.net/

3. Skywater Pdk: The SkyWater Open Source PDK is a collaboration between Google and SkyWater Technology Foundry to provide a fully open source Process Design Kit and related resources, which can be used to create manufacturable designs at SkyWaterâ€™s facility. As of May 2020, this repository is targeting the SKY130 process node. If the SKY130 process node release is successful then in the future more advanced technology nodes may become available. For more info refer: https://github.com/google/skywater-pdk, https://skywater-pdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

4. Magic: Magic is a venerable VLSI layout tool, written in the 1980's at Berkeley by John Ousterhout, now famous primarily for writing the scripting interpreter language Tcl. Due largely in part to its liberal Berkeley open-source license, magic has remained popular with universities and small companies. The open-source license has allowed VLSI engineers with a bent toward programming to implement clever ideas and help magic stay abreast of fabrication technology. However, it is the well thought-out core algorithms which lend to magic the greatest part of its popularity. Magic is widely cited as being the easiest tool to use for circuit layout, even for people who ultimately rely on commercial tools for their product design flow.

# Differences between Prelayout and Postlayout and Why?
1. There is a fall in the gain and changes in other plots as well of postlayout simulation due to various reasons like very high resistances in order of MegaOhms and GigaOhms is difficult to achieve as the length of the resistor is very high for these ranges.
2. There is a change in frequency response  as high value of capacitance of order of micro and milli Farad is difficult to achieve as the size increases. There are various other reasons like substrate capacitance and various other stray capacitances.
3. Also at high values of resistors and capacitors, accurately calculating the sizes becomes an important factor. Slight variation in calculation results deviation from ther prelayout simulation.

# Future Scope
More accurate responses can be achieved if the above drawbacks can be considered. Any other material for the layout of resistors and capacitors can also be used for better results.
