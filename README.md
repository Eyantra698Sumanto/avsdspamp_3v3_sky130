# avsdspamp_3v3_sky130
This project focuses on design of a Sziklai Pair Amplifier using Google Skywater (sky130) Technology node with operating voltage of 1.8V and 3.3V. The project is build using Open Source Tools like Magic, Sky130PDK and eSim.

# Opensource Tools used:
1. eSim: eSim (previously known as Oscad / FreeEDA) is a free/libre and open source EDA tool for circuit design, simulation, analysis and PCB design developed by FOSSEE, IIT Bombay. It is an integrated tool    built using free/libre and open source software such as KiCad, Ngspice and GHDL. eSim is released under GPL.

eSim offers similar capabilities and ease of use as any equivalent proprietary software for schematic creation, simulation and PCB design, without having to pay a huge amount of money to procure licenses. Hence it can be an affordable alternative to educational institutions and SMEs. It can serve as an alternative to commercially available/licensed software tools like OrCAD, Xpedition and HSPICE.

2. Ngspice: Ngspice is the open source spice simulator for electric and electronic circuits. Ngspice offers a wealth of device models for active, passive, analog, and digital elements. Model parameters are provided by the semiconductor manufacturers. The user add her circuits as a netlist, and the output is one or more graphs of currents, voltages and other electrical quantities or is saved in a data file.
